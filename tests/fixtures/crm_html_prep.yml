        invasion is one of the most threatening factors for biodiversity conservation.
        Lacking information on alien species in certain regions of the world hampers
        a balanced understanding of invasion processes and efficient data exchange
        among stakeholders. Current knowledge gaps are in need of urgent concern.
        We therefore conducted a review on alien animals in Xinjiang, an unknown region
        of invasion ecology. Xinjiang lies in the heartland of the Asian continent,
        covering an area of 1,664,900 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>. In the past 64 years,
        128 alien animal species were recorded in this region, 39% of which became
        invasive and led to loss of native biodiversity. Most of these species were
        introduced through diversification of local agriculture and aquaculture. This
        process was aggravated by improving transportation and flourishing trade.
        Multiple linear regression models and correlation analysis were run for explaining
        influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on status of alien animals:
        economically developed areas with abundant water resource, oases in particular,
        were prone to be hotspots of alien animal species in this arid and semi-arid
        region. This study also revealed that taxonomically biased and lagged research
        were critical problems that impeded studies on biological invasions in Xinjiang,
        and proposed feasible solutions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1545","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,12]],"date-time":"2016-01-12T09:12:08Z","timestamp":1452589928000},"page":"e1545","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Unveiling

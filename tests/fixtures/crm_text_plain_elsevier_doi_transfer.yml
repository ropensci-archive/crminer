        \n               Abstract\n               \n                  This study investigates
        the link between corporate board features and corporate performance for a
        sample of 286 publicly traded firms from South Africa (84 firms), Sweden (94
        firms), and the UK (108 firms). Corporate board features considered are board
        composition, inside director ownership, duality and board size. In contrast
        to prior literature, performance is defined as the efficiency of value added
        (VA) rather than in financial terms. Further, the analysis examines the association
        between board features and efficiency of VA and each of the firm's physical
        capital (PC) and intellectual capital (IC), respectively. Finally, the present
        study analyzes the association between board features and corporate performance
        conjointly. Comparable to general findings from studies using U.S. data, the
        empirical analysis as a whole did not discern consistent significant link
        between the four board features and corporate performance across the three
        nations. However, individual board features are found to influence corporate
        performance in isolated cases. Overall, results provide evidence that even
        under different sociopolitical and economic conditions, governance needs vary
        across firms. Consequently, these findings do not lend support to the notion
        that uniform board structures should be mandated.\n               \n             0

        \  Abstract This study investigates the link between corporate board features
        and corporate performance for a sample of 286 publicly traded firms from South
        Africa (84 firms), Sweden (94 firms), and the UK (108 firms). Corporate board
        features considered are board composition, inside director ownership, duality
        and board size. In contrast to prior literature, performance is defined as
        the efficiency of value added (VA) rather than in financial terms. Further,
        the analysis examines the association between board features and efficiency
        of VA and each of the firm's physical capital (PC) and intellectual capital
        (IC), respectively. Finally, the present study analyzes the association between
        board features and corporate performance conjointly. Comparable to general
        findings from studies using U.S. data, the empirical analysis as a whole did
        not discern consistent significant link between the four board features and
        corporate performance across the three nations. However, individual board
        features are found to influence corporate performance in isolated cases. Overall,
        results provide evidence that even under different sociopolitical and economic
        conditions, governance needs vary across firms. Consequently, these findings
        do not lend support to the notion that uniform board structures should be
        mandated.   Keywords Efficiency value added  Board structure  Intellectual
        capital  Physical capital  Corporate governance    1 Introduction Corporate
        governance concerns in publicly listed firms with diffuse ownership are well
        known and long established (i.e., Berle & Means, 1932; Hermalin & Weisbach,
        2001; Shleifer & Vishny, 1997 ). Financial scandals in various nations during
        the 1980s reignited debate—that continues to the present—on the most appropriate
        mechanisms for making corporate management more accountable to shareholders
        and other relevant stakeholders (Demirag, Sudarsanam, & Wright, 2000) . Boards
        of directors have been at the epicentre of this debate (Bhagat & Black, 1999;
        Vafeas & Theodorou, 1998) . Members of boards of directors have been extensively
        criticized for being complacent in their monitoring role, and/or relinquishing
        control to corporate managers who pursue their own self-interests (Dalton,
        Daily, Johnson, & Ellstrand, 1999) . Also, boards of directors are accused
        of being remiss in their accountability to stakeholders (Coffey & Wang, 1998)
        . Because poor corporate performance is viewed to be a major by-product of
        an ineffective board of directors, various corporate governance reform advocates
        frequently argue appropriate changes to its’ composition, structure and ownership
        configuration1  1 For the purposes of the present paper, board composition
        refers to the make-up of the board such as the number of directors and mix
        of inside and outside directors. The phrase board structure is utilized to
        designate particular structural characteristics that may include presence
        or absence of a standing committee and whether a single individual or two
        separate people undertake the roles of CEO and Chairperson of the board. Finally,
        board ownership configuration relates to the ownership levels of the board.
        This may include such features as the percentage of outstanding shares owned
        by inside or outside directors and presence or absence of a block holder on
        the board.   will enhance both corporate governance and corporate performance.
        The association between board features and corporate performance has frequently
        been questioned, both in conceptual (i.e., Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Mace,
        1972; Molz, 1995 ) and empirical studies (i.e., Daily & Dalton, 1994; Kesner,
        1988; Kosnik, 1987 ). In this study we provide an international comparative
        analysis of the association between board features and corporate performance
        drawing on data (hand collected) from 284 publicly listed firms from South
        Africa (SA) (n =84), Sweden (n =94) and the UK (n =108). Earlier studies (i.e.,
        La Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1997; La Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes,
        Shleifer, & Vishny, 1998 ) clearly indicate that key elements of the corporate
        governance environment—such as the legal system and capital markets—vary across
        national boundaries. An international comparative analysis is, therefore,
        warranted since prior empirical research findings are generally derived using
        data solely from the United States (Vafeas & Theodorou, 1998) . Corporate
        governance guidelines published during the 1990s and early 2000s, however,
        often emphasized the concept of value added (henceforth denoted as VA ) as
        a primary objective of a firm's board of directors. However, prior studies
        generally define corporate performance in financial terms with a small number
        applying societal level concepts (i.e., corporate social and environmental
        responsibility (Frankforter, Berman, & Jones, 2000) . In a departure from
        prior research, the present study empirically examines the association between
        board features and corporate performance, with performance defined as the
        efficiency of VA by a firm's total resource base (hereafter TVAE). Also, recognizing
        that a firm's resource base consists of physical capital (PC) and intellectual
        capital (IC), we conjecture that the different properties underlying PC and
        IC resources will lead corporate management to adopt dissimilar approaches
        to the use and application of each type of resource base. The influence of
        board features on corporate performance could then depend on the firm's mix
        of PC and IC resources. A unique feature of the present study, therefore,
        is extending the analysis to test for the association between board features
        and (1) efficiency of VA by a firm's PC—resources (hereafter TVAPC) and (2)
        efficiency of VA by a firm's IC—resources (hereafter TVAIC). We use the Value
        Added Intellectual Capital (VAIC) methodology (i.e., Pulic, 1998 ) to develop
        proxies for TVAE, TVAPC, and TVAIC.2  2 Whilst the empirical results and discussion
        reported in the present study primarily focus on proxies developed in line
        with the VAIC methodology, a comparison with findings using traditional market-
        and accounting-based measures of corporate performance is also provided in
        the Results section .   Finally, much of the extant literature generally examines
        the association between single board features and corporate performance. Vafeas
        and Theodorou (1998, p. 403)  suggest that attempts to establish the existence
        of such association without controlling for the influence of other corporate
        governance characteristics may “lead to spurious relationships and misguided
        conclusions.” This study attempts to mitigate this concern. SA, Sweden and
        the UK were selected for this study for several key reasons. First, during
        the 1990s and early 2000s corporate governance was a major issue for all three.
        New corporate governance guidelines and regulations were published in SA (King
        Report I , 1994 ; King Report II, 2002  ,), Sweden (Corporate governance policy,
        \ 1993 , 2001 ) and the UK (Cadbury Report, 1992; Turnball Report, 1998)  during
        this period. The goal was to enhance corporate monitoring and performance
        through the proper employment of more effective board features. It is important,
        therefore, to investigate the possible impact of such recommendations on corporate
        performance. Second, there is also a common historical link between corporate
        governance guidelines and regulations published in the three nations since
        1992; specifically, the Cadbury Report (1992)  has commonly been used as the
        initial point of reference in the construction of corporate governance guidelines
        and regulations. Third, an understanding and familiarity with the concept
        of IC is another reason for concentrating on SA, Sweden and the UK. Swedish
        firms, for example, are the acknowledged ‘forefathers’ in the development
        of the concept of IC and its recognition as a distinctive discipline (Bontis,
        1998, 2000) . Since the mid-1990s IC has established a strong and growing
        presence in both the SA and the UK business and political environment (Mouritsen,
        Larsen, & Bukh, 2001; Williams, 2001) . Fourth, the concept of VA features
        prominently in each nation's social, scholarly, and business environments
        (Stainbank, 1997; Van Staden, 1999) . For example, at the time of the present
        study, SA firms voluntarily provided more value-added statements than any
        other nation while the vast bulk of academic research on this concept emerged
        from the UK (Van Staden, 2000) . Finally, the developed capital market and
        financial reporting environments in SA, Sweden, and the UK have enabled collection
        of relevant data from a relatively sizeable number of economically significant
        firms in each nation. Whilst there are dissimilarities among these three nations,
        such as in the legal system and state of economic development, this should
        not have an adverse effect on this study. The remainder of this paper is organized
        as follows: Section 2  provides an overview the corporate governance environment
        in SA, Sweden and the UK. A discussion of the potential influence of board
        features on the efficiency of VA by a firm's combined resources and that by
        the major resource elements of a firm—PC and IC—follows. Testable hypotheses
        are also developed in this section. An outline of the research design and
        descriptive statistics related to the sample data is then presented in Section
        4 . Empirical results are then reported. In the concluding section , ideas
        for future research are discussed.  2 Overview of corporate governance in
        South Africa, Sweden and United Kingdom There is presently a lack of consensus
        on a precise definition of corporate governance. For the purposes of the present
        study, corporate governance is viewed to encompass the dimensions of law,
        regulation and suitable voluntary corporate practice that enables the “corporation
        to attract financial and human capital, perform efficiently, and thereby perpetuate
        itself by generating long-term economic value for its shareholders, while
        respecting the interests of stakeholders and society as a whole” (Gregory,
        2001a, p. 1) . Given key dimensions, such as the legal order and regulatory
        environment vary between countries, studying corporate governance practices
        across national boundaries is of interest. Table 1   is a summary of major
        features of the corporate governance system and factors influencing practices
        in SA, Sweden and the UK. La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) , argue that the legal
        order is a key institutional determinant of the development of corporate governance
        practices and of understanding of related enforcement regulations. In the
        UK, Common law—based on precedents established by courts—is the primary source
        of legal principles and rules, while statutory law forms the cornerstone of
        legal principles and rules in Sweden. Conversely, legal principles and rules
        in SA are dually influenced by the major codification practices of Roman–Germanic
        (Dutch) law and case law of the Common law legal system. Also, the extent
        of shareholder and creditor rights may influence corporate governance practices
        (La Porta et al., 1997, 1998) . Shareholder rights in SA and the UK are quite
        comparable, although levels are slightly lower in Sweden. Creditor rights
        are lowest in Sweden and highest in the UK (La Porta et al., 1997, 1998) .
        In sum, corporate management and boards of directors of UK firms are more
        likely than SA or Sweden to face greater pressure to ensure achieving appropriate
        corporate governance practices and standards. This difference is likely due
        to greater protection and enforceability of shareholder rights and creditor
        rights. The quality of a nation's accounting profession and standards and
        the resulting financial transparency are other measures of corporate governance
        effectiveness. According to La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) , the quality of
        accounting standards is highest in Sweden and lowest in SA. This implies financial
        transparency is likely to be more extensive amongst Swedish firms followed
        by those in the UK and SA. Prior research suggests ownership structure influences
        corporate governance practices. For example, ownership diffusion can extrapolate
        managerial opportunism while block holdings may enhance (or impede) the monitoring
        of corporate management (Frankforter et al., 2000) . The level of ownership
        amongst firms is most diffused in the UK with SA having the highest concentration
        of ownership. Unlike Companies Acts and related regulations in SA, in Sweden
        and the UK, specific guidelines designed to formally institutionalize corporate
        governance practices were published during the 1990s and early 2000s. It is
        argued that compliance with these guidelines may depend in part on (1) the
        agency issuing the guidelines, (2) whether guidelines were appended to any
        institutional requirements and (3) disclosure requirements. In Sweden, guidelines
        were developed by private agencies not supported or appended to the requirements
        of a major institutional body (such as the stock exchange) and compliance
        is purely voluntary. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), a private body,
        also strongly supported the development of guidelines in SA with recommendations
        of the King Report I  (1994)  and II (2002)  appended to the listing requirements
        of the JSE. Also, debtor firms are required to disclose the extent of compliance
        with King Report I  (1994)  and II (2002)  guidelines. In the UK, development
        of recent guidelines were initiated by major institutional bodies such as
        the London Stock Exchange (1998)  and Institute of Chartered Accountants in
        England and Wales. As in SA, UK guidelines—condensed into the Combined Code:
        Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice (1998) —are appended
        to the listing requirements of the London Stock Exchange. Also, UK firms are
        required to disclose their compliance with these guidelines. Various recommendations
        arising from these reports cover issues relevant to the present study. These
        include the objective of the board, board size, board composition and leadership
        structure. In respect to the objective of the board, Swedish and UK guidelines
        emphasize the main duty of the board is to promote shareholders' interests
        and maximize shareholder value. Guidelines in SA also acknowledge a board's
        responsibility to shareholders but the overall objective stresses the need
        for boards to act in the interests of a wider range of stakeholders. Of the
        three nations included in the present study, only Swedish guidelines make
        direct recommendations on the size of the board. Conversely, guidelines in
        all three nations express a preference for the board of directors to contain
        an appropriate balance of executive and nonexecutive (affiliated and independent)
        directors. Swedish guidelines, however, express greater need for nonexecutive
        director representation in particular as firm size increases. Finally, guidelines
        in each nation place heavy emphasis on the segregation of the positions of
        chief executive officer (CEO) and Chairperson to minimize duality related
        conflicts.3  3 Duality refers to the situation when an executive holds both
        the position of chief executive officer (CEO) and Chairperson of the board.
        \   3 Prior literature, theory and hypothesis development Generally, the majority
        of empirical studies examining corporate performance links have defined corporate
        performance primarily within financial terms and used either financial accounting
        or market-based measures as proxies for corporate performance. Few studies
        seek to analyze the association between board features and corporate performance
        within the context of VA (i.e., Morck, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1988; Hermalin
        & Weisbach, 1991 ). The concept of VA (also referred to as wealth creation)4
        \ 4 Formally, VA was defined as the wealth created (or contributed) by the
        firm through the utilization of its key productive resources (Suojanen, 1954;
        Van Staden, 1998) .   is increasingly viewed as the primary objective of a
        firm more so than financial performance. Clarkson (1994, p. 21) , for example,
        states that the “purpose of the firm is to create wealth or value for its
        stakeholders by converting their stakes into goods and services.” Some corporate
        governance advocates highlight the potential association between board features
        and VA. Blair (1995, p. 322)  argues that it is critical for VA “to enhance
        the voice of and provide ownership-like incentives to those participants in
        the firm who contribute or control critical, specialized inputs and to align
        the interests of these critical stakeholders with the interests of outside,
        passive shareholders and other related stakeholders.” The voice of key participants,
        for instance, could be enhanced through suitable representation on the board
        of directors. In the case of executive directors, ownership incentives may
        help align their interests with shareholders and other important stakeholders.
        Prior research indicates corporate managers are generally risk-averse due
        to their dependence on the firm for their immediate livelihood (Vafeas & Theodorou,
        1998) . With a preference for reducing uncertainty, corporate managers are
        likely to support policies and strategies related to PC than IC resources
        because they are better able to directly control the former (Mahnke, 1997)
        . This condition arises because ownership in PC resources is attributed to
        shareholders who then pass responsibility for their use to corporate management.
        Consequently, control of IC resources may not be within the direct power of
        a corporate manager. Without direct control, corporate managers have less
        ability to apply ex ante monitoring criteria and cannot as easily make adjustments
        on a continuous basis to reduce uncertainties (Mahnke, 1997) . Another personal
        characteristic of corporate managers is their myopic nature (Vanes & Theodorou,
        1998) . From a time horizon perspective, VA generated from PC resources is
        likely to take less time than VA generated from IC resources. IC resources
        cannot be purchased via business transactions and require lengthy periods
        of development and refinement offering few guarantees of becoming operational
        (Mahnke, 1997) . Under enormous pressure to produce immediate results, “short
        terms” may lead corporate managers to avoid investing in IC resources. A review
        of the literature indicates four major board features—representation or compositions
        (proportion of outside directors and board size), structure (duality) and
        ownership (percentage of inside ownership)—often thought to influence corporate
        performance. The following subsections reviews the theoretical and empirical
        literature related to these four boards features in developing hypotheses
        relevant to an association with TVAE, TVAPC and TVAIC. 3.1 Proportion of outside
        directors on a firm's board of directors The proposition that outside directors
        are instrumental in guiding a firm's performance is supported by several theoretical
        perspectives (including agency theory, resource-dependence theory and stakeholder
        theory) and has been the central emphasis of various recent corporate governance
        guideline publications (e.g., Cadbury Report, 1992 ; King Report I,  1994
        ). From a stakeholder perspective, stakeholder orientations are likely to
        be more diversified amongst outside directors relative to inside directors
        (Young, Stedham, & Beekun, 2000) . Also, outside directors are often hired
        to assist in managing a firm's various stakeholders (Johnson & Greening, 1999;
        Pfeffer, 1973) . Finally, as Wang and Dewhirst (1992, p. 120)  state, “outside
        directors have a very strong stakeholder orientation, and recognize that their
        responsibility encompasses more than shareholders and are very conscious about
        the needs and expectations of the various constituencies of their firms.”
        Outside directors also have vested interest in fulfilling their responsibilities;
        they need to protect their “reputation-capital” so as to enhance future directorship
        opportunities. In contrast, inside directors have strong self-interest orientations
        as they rely on the firm for their immediate livelihood (Johnson et al., 1993;
        Zahra & Pearce, 1989) . While the above reasoning appears compelling, the
        empirical results of association between the proportion of outside directors
        and corporate performance are mixed. Rosenstein and Wyatt (1990, 1997)  find
        positive excess returns following the announcement of the appointment of an
        outside director, which is supported by Byrd and Hickman (1992); Mayers, Shivdasani,
        Smith (1997)  and Weisbach (1988) . There is a suggestion that these findings
        are due to sample selection, which is conditioned to events potentially requiring
        good decision-making, a major function of outside directors (Frankforter et
        al., 2000) . In contrast, large cross-sectional studies fail to indicate any
        relationship (Agrawal & Knoeber, 1996; Hermalin & Weisbach, 1991) . Finally,
        other empirical findings show that inside directors, rather then outside directors,
        are essential to corporate performance (i.e., Cochran et al., 1985; Kesner
        et al., 1986; Singh & Harianto, 1989 ). Despite conflicting empirical results,
        it is important in the current environment to analyze the association between
        the proportion of outside directors and corporate performance in settings
        other than that of the United States, and using other concepts of performance.
        Therefore, consistent with the stakeholder perspective, we propose the following
        hypotheses:Hypothesis 1a There is a positive association between the proportion
        of outside directors to total directors of publicly listed firms in SA, Sweden,
        and UK and TVAE.  Hypothesis 1b There is a positive association between the
        proportion of outside directors to total directors of publicly listed firms
        in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAPC.  Hypothesis 1c There is a positive association
        between the proportion of outside directors to total directors of publicly
        listed firms in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAIC.    3.2 Ownership concentration
        of inside directors of a firm's board of directors Inside directors form a
        significant stakeholder group contributing critical specialized inputs. Under
        the stakeholder framework the provision of ownership-like incentives to inside
        directors helps align perceptions with the interests of other stakeholder
        groups. Zahra, Oviatt, and Minyard (1993)  suggest ownership gives greater
        motivation to inside directors to develop better strategies allowing for effective
        resource allocation to the different stakeholders of a firm. Hansen and Hill
        (1991)  argue that ownership incentive realignment motivates inside directors
        to forgo short-term returns for long-term projects and strategies. Johnson
        and Greening (1999, p. 570) , further state that ownership inspires inside
        directors to “maintain or improve product quality and innovation through increased
        R&D spending.” Finally, Finkelstein (1992)  argues that ownership empowers
        inside directors, enabling them to generate new business incentives and strategies,
        increase innovation and enable the firm to adapt more quickly to a changing
        environment. As with the case of outside directors the empirical evidence
        on inside directors is mixed. Some studies have reported no association (Demsetz
        & Lehn, 1985; Leech & Leahy, 1991; Vafeas & Theodorou, 1998) . In contrast,
        the empirical findings of McConnell and Servaes (1990)  and Conyon and Leech
        (1994)  report a positive relationship. Alternatively, the empirical findings
        of Morck et al. (1988)  imply an elliptical relationship. That is, as inside
        directors' ownership increased to approximately 5% of total outstanding shares,
        corporate performance improved. For ownership levels between 5% and 25% there
        was a decline whilst ownership above 25% again showed improved corporate performance.
        Given these inconsistent results, based largely on US data, we propose the
        following hypotheses:Hypothesis 2a There is a positive association between
        the percentage of inside directors' ownership of publicly listed firms in
        SA, Sweden and UK and TVAE.  Hypothesis 2b There is a positive association
        between the percentage of inside directors' ownership of publicly listed firms
        in SA, Sweden and UK and TVAPC.  Hypothesis 2c There is a positive association
        between the percentage of inside directors' ownership of publicly listed firms
        in SA, Sweden and UK and TVAIC.    3.3 Leadership structure (duality) The
        impact of duality on corporate performance is of interest to advocates of
        various schools of thought (i.e., Dalton & Kesner, 1985; Hambrick & Mason,
        1984; Patton & Baker, 1987 ). From a stakeholder perception, duality seriously
        impedes the overall stakeholder orientation of members of the board. Sonnenfeld
        (1981) , for example, argues that executives acting as both CEO and Chairperson
        are biased in their stakeholder orientations toward corporate management.
        That is, the joint CEO/Chairperson is likely to support the implementation
        of policies benefiting corporate management at the expense of other stakeholders
        (Ford & McLaughlin, 1984) . Also, both the positions of CEO and Chairperson
        are positions of considerable power. Combining them enables the joint CEO/Chairperson
        to establish greater strategic influence and power that may intimidate other
        directors. Consequently, other board members may be reluctant to support strategies
        and policies contrary to the interests of corporate management for fear of
        incurring the disapproval of their leader (Mallette & Fowler, 1992) . Dividing
        the positions of CEO and Chairperson of the Board disperses power and authority,
        thereby enhancing the board of directors' ability to effectively implement
        decisions addressing the interests of a more diverse set of stakeholders (Wang
        & Dewhirst, 1992) . Finally, eliminating duality enhances the board's information-processing
        capacities by enabling more key people to be involved in the decision-making
        process (Sanders and Carpenter, 1998) . Empirical research offers limited
        inconclusive findings on duality. Rechner and Dalton (1991)  and Pi and Timme
        (1993) , for example, find firms separating the two roles consistently outperformed
        counterparts that combined the two positions. Brickley, Coles, and Jarrell
        (1997)  and Vafeas and Theodorou (1998)  find contradictory results, however,
        to further investigate the aforementioned association the following hypotheses
        are formed based on the foregoing arguments:Hypothesis 3a There is a negative
        association between the same director jointly holding the roles of CEO and
        Chairperson of publicly listed firms in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAE.  Hypothesis
        3b There is a negative association between the same director jointly holding
        the roles of CEO and Chairperson of publicly listed firms in SA, Sweden, and
        UK and TVAPC.  Hypothesis 3c There is a negative association between the same
        director jointly holding the roles of CEO and Chairperson of publicly listed
        firms in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAIC.    3.4 Size of the board of directors
        While there are suggestions for finding an association between board size
        and corporate performance (i.e., Alexander, Fennell, & Halpern, 1993; Kidwell
        & Bennett, 1993; Provan, 1980 ), no consensus exist, as to the direction of
        this association. Advocates of the stakeholder perspective generally support
        a positive association. A larger board allows greater balance, thereby, promoting
        more effective decision making while increasing harmony between a firm's stakeholders.
        Finally, a larger board enhances information-processing capabilities and the
        quality of advice given to corporate management (Zahra and Pearce, 1989) .
        Alternatively, agency theorists generally argue for smaller boards reasoning
        that as size increases control and monitoring functions are impaired (Dalton
        et al., 1999; Judge & Zeithaml, 1992) . Agency theory advocates also argue
        that larger board size increases the opportunity for manipulation by corporate
        management. For example, Jensen (1993, p. 865)  state that when “boards get
        beyond seven or eight people they are less likely to function effectively
        and are easier for the CEO to control.” Finally, some suggest larger board
        size leads to less participation and cohesion among members, thus, diminishing
        the ability to achieve a consensus on control decisions (Evans and Dion, 1991;
        Lipton and Lorsch, 1992) . Empirical analysis has failed to resolve the theoretical
        debate surrounding the association between board size and corporate performance.
        Burt (1980) , and Bazerman and Schoorman (1983) , for example, state that
        larger boards are able to establish far greater interlocks with stakeholders
        processing resources vital to the firm. These affiliations enable firms to
        operate more effectively. Similarly, Chaganti et al. (1985)  find that the
        boards of firms filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection are smaller in
        size than a matched sample of nonfailing firms. They concluded that larger
        board size is more effective in preventing corporate failure than is the case
        for smaller boards. Conversely, Yermack (1996)  shows that higher market evaluation,
        as well as higher returns on assets and returns on sales, are associated with
        firms having smaller boards. Yermack (1996)  concludes that any benefits associated
        with large board size are undermined by poor communication and decision-making
        processes. Given the inconsistent empirical results, further investigation
        of board size and corporate performance links is required. Based on the foregoing
        arguments it is hypothesized that,Hypothesis 4a There is a positive association
        between the number of members of the board of directors of publicly listed
        firms in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAE.  Hypothesis 4b There is a positive association
        between the number of members of the board of directors of publicly listed
        firms in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAPC.  Hypothesis 4c There is a positive
        association between the number of members of the board of directors publicly
        listed firms in SA, Sweden, and UK and TVAIC.     4 Research method 4.1 Measure
        of dependent variables The Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) methodology
        developed by Pulic (1998)  forms the measurement basis for the three dependent
        variables in the present study. VAIC is an analytical procedure designed to
        enable management, shareholders and other relevant stakeholders to effectively
        monitor and evaluate the efficiency of VA by a firm's total resources as well
        as each major resource component. Formally, VAIC is a composite sum of three
        indicators formally termed (1) Capital Employed Efficiency (CEE)—indicator
        of VA efficiency of capital employed; (2) Human Capital Efficiency (HCE)—indicator
        of VA efficiency of human capital; and (3) Structural Capital Efficiency (SCE)—indicator
        of VA efficiency of structural capital. Eq. (1)  formalizes the VAIC relationship
        algebraically:(1) VAIC i =CEE i +HCE i +SCE i    Where VAICi  =VA intellectual
        coefficient for company i ; CEEi  =VA capital employed coefficient for company
        i ; HCEi  =human capital coefficient for company i ; and SCEi  =structural
        capital VA for company i . Pulic (1998) , states that the higher the VAIC
        coefficient, the better the efficiency of VA by a firm's total resources.
        The first step in calculating CEE, HCE and SCE is to determine a firm's total
        VA. This calculation is defined by the following relationship5  5 Prior research
        has defined VA by the following algebraic equation: Rev – B + Inv=W +I+DP+D+T+M+R
        [Eq. (7a)] or S–B+Inv–DP=W+I+DP+D+T+M+R [Eq. (7b)]. W refers to total salary
        and wage expense. Eq. (7a) is commonly referred to as the gross VA and Eq.
        (7b) is termed the net VA. Theoretical arguments have been forwarded supporting
        both approaches. Empirical research indicates both methods have been used
        in practice. Pulic (1998)  argues that because of the central active role
        human resources plays in the value creation process, labour costs (wages expense)
        should not be included in VA computations. This view is consistent with the
        opinions of other IC experts (Edvinsson, 1997; Sveiby, 2000) .  :(2) VA i
        =Ii +DP i +Di +Ti +Mi +Ri    Where VA for firm i  computed as the sum of interest
        expenses (I i  ); depreciation expenses (DPi  ); dividends (D i  ); corporate
        taxes (T i  ); equity of minority shareholders in net income of subsidiaries
        (M i  ); and profits retained for the year (R i  ). Pulic (1998)  also states
        that CEE is:(3) CEE i =VA i /CE i    Where CEEi  =capital employed efficiency
        coefficient for company i ; VAi  =VA for firm i  (see formal definition above);
        and CEi  =book value of the net assets for firm i . Consistent with views
        of Edvinsson (1997)  and Pulic (1998); Sveiby (2001)  argues total salary
        and wage costs are an indicator of a firm's human capital (HC). HCE, therefore,
        is calculated as:(4) HCE i =VA i /HC i    Where HCEi  =human capital efficiency
        coefficient for company i ; VAi  =VA for firm i  (see formal definition above);
        and HCi  =total investment salary and wage for firm i . To calculate SCE,
        it is first necessary to determine the value of a firm's structural capital
        (SC) which Pulic (1998)  proposes as:(5) SC i =VA i −HC i    Where SCi  =structural
        capital for company i ; VAi  =VA for firm i  (see formal definition above);
        and HCi  =total salary and wage costs for firm i . Pulic (1998)  argues there
        is a proportionate inverse relationship between HC and SC. Consequently, Pulic
        (1998)  proposes calculating SCE as:(6) SCE i =SC i /VA i    Where SCEi  =structural
        capital efficiency coefficient for company i ; SCi  =structural capital for
        company i ; and VAi  =VA for firm i  (see formal definition above). For this
        study, VAIC scores are a proxy for TVAE; CEE scores proxy for TVAPC; and the
        sum of HCE and SCE scores proxy for TVAIC. Appendix A  presents a formal illustration
        of the calculation of each dependent variable using the VAIC methodology.
        Apart from encompassing the concept of VA and enabling one to decipher the
        VA efficiency of a firm's PC and IC resources, several other major reasons
        underscore the use of the VAIC methodology. First, VAIC provides a standardized
        and consistent basis of measure (Pulic & Bornemann, 1999) , and thereby, enables
        the effective conduct of an international comparative analysis. Alternative
        IC measures are limited (Roos, Roos, Dragonetti, & Edvinsson, 1997; Sullivan,
        2000)  and the ability to apply alternative IC measures consistently across
        a large and diversified sample for comparative analysis is diminished. Second,
        all data used in the VAIC calculation are based on audited information; therefore,
        the calculations can be considered objective and verifiable (Pulic, 1998,
        2000) . Other IC measures have been criticized due to subjectivity in measurement
        and difficulty in verification (Sveiby, 2000; Williams, 2001) . Third, VAIC
        is a straightforward technique that enhances cognitive understanding and enables
        ease of calculation by various internal and external stakeholders (Schneider,
        1999) . Finally, the VAIC methodology is receiving more attention in research
        and application (see, e.g., Bornemann and Franzen, 1998; Nova Kreditna banka
        Maribor, 2000; Williams, 2001 ).  4.2 Proxy measures for independent variables
        and control factors In addition to the four independent variables, five control
        factors (profitability, leverage, dividend yield, industry type, and firm
        size) are included in all the multiple regression analysis. Standard proxies,
        identified from a review of the literature (i.e., Daily & Dalton, 1994; Mallette
        & Fowler, 1992; Oviatt, 1988; Vafeas & Theodorou, 1998; Young et al., 2000
        ) are used to measure the independent variables and control factors in this
        study. Each proxy is formally defined below, plus the expected directional
        relationship with the dependent variables:1. Percentage of outside directors
        on the board (PerOutDir) : number of directors on the board, not directly
        employed with or have professional ties with the firm, as a percentage of
        total board size—positive relationship with dependent variable;  2. Percentage
        of outstanding shares owned by inside directors (PerInsOwn) : ratio of number
        of outstanding common shares held by directors to the total number of outstanding
        common shares of the firm—positive direction with dependent variable;  3.
        Leadership structure of the board (Duality) : dummy variable with firms having
        the same individual acting as the CEO and chairperson of the board being scored
        a one, otherwise a zero—negative relationship with dependent variable;  4.
        Board size (Board Size) : number of directors serving on the board—negative
        relationship with dependent variable;  5. Profitability (ROA) : ratio of the
        net income (less preference dividends) divided by total assets as reported
        in the 1998 annual report—positive relationship to dependent variable;  6.
        Leverage (Leverage) : total debt divided by total shareholders' equity as
        reported in each firm's annual report—negative relationship to dependent variable;
        \ 7. Dividend yield (Dividend Yield) :—percentage of cash dividends paid during
        1998 divided by total shareholders' equity—positive relationship to dependent
        variable;  8. R&D sensitivity (Industry Type) : dummy variable with firm's
        determined to be R&D intensive6  6 A firm was defined as being R&D sensitive
        if it separately disclosed the amount of R&D expense in their annual report.
        \  coded a one (1), otherwise coded a zero (0) (Sanders & Carpenter, 1998;
        Wruck, 1993) —positive relationship to dependent variable; and  9. Firm Size
        (Size of the Firm) : natural log of annual sales as reported in each firm's
        annual report—positive relationship to dependent variable.     4.3 Sample
        data Data were hand-collected from 1998 fiscal year annual reports7  7 In
        SA and Sweden the 1998 fiscal year was generally from 1/1/1998 to 31/12/1998
        whilst in UK it was from 1/4/1998 – 31/3/1999. The time difference is not
        considered detrimental to the results of this study as no significant events
        occurred that may have unduly influenced the findings.   of publicly traded
        firms listed on the Johannesburg (SA), Stockholm (Sweden) and London (UK)
        stock exchanges. Consistent with prior research, financial and utility sector
        firms were excluded (Firth, Lohne, Ropstad, & Sjo, 1996; Vafeas & Theodorou,
        1998) . Various techniques—direct contact, database, and website searches—were
        used to collect the final useable sample of 286 (84 in SA; 94 in Sweden; and
        108 in UK) annual reports.8  8 Nonresponse tests were conducted to determine
        if there were any significant differences between companies from the original
        240 companies selected that were included in the final survey to those excluded.
        Statistical tests showed no significant variations. Consequently, it was concluded
        there was no significant nonresponse bias.   Table 2   reports descriptive
        statistics for the dependent and independent variables and control factors
        for the sample as a whole (Panel A) and by nation (SA—Panel B; Sweden—Panel
        C; and UK—Panel D). Descriptive statistics related to the independent variables
        indicate that board structures vary among SA, Sweden, and UK. The average
        (median) percentage of outside directors (PerOutDir ) is 51.91% (52.79%) in
        SA, 78.29% (81.46%) in Sweden and 48.50% (42.57%) in UK. Compared to the United
        States, the proportion of outside directors is lower in SA and UK but higher
        in Sweden. Average PerInsOwn  in SA, Sweden, and UK is 9.70%, 1.75%, and 6.42%,
        respectively. Median values (2.98%—SA; 0.05%—Sweden; and 0.11%—UK) indicate,
        however, that PerInsOwn  values are heavily skewed to the right. PerOwnIns
        \ in SA, Sweden, and UK are generally lower than that reported for US firms.
        Duality  is most prominent in SA (61.43% with same CEO/Chairperson) closely
        followed by the UK (53.70%). These proportions are similar to the United States
        (i.e., Roa & Lee-Sing, 1995; Klein, 1998, 2002 ). Comparatively, Swedish firms
        (20.64%) show a greater propensity to segregate the two roles of the Chairperson
        and CEO. Finally, average Board size  in SA (13.02) is moderately higher than
        in the United States, but is comparable in both Sweden (9.28) and UK (9.54).
        Overall, firms in the sample have reasonably high ROA  values. Average Leverage
        \ levels are also relatively similar. Comparatively, UK firms generally paid
        more dividends per unit of shareholders equity than firms in SA and Sweden.
        Across the entire sample, approximately three out of five firms were coded
        “R&D Intensive”, with Sweden having the highest proportion of “R&D Intensive”
        firms whilst SA has the lowest proportion. Finally, average sales turnover
        was highest amongst UK firms followed by Sweden. The efficiency of total VA
        of a firm's combined resource base is, on average highest in UK followed by
        SA. In SA and Sweden, IC is the most significant resource base contributing
        to the efficiency of VA, whilst in the UK it is PC. Relative to prior VAIC
        studies9  9 Pulic (2000) , for example, studied 30 firms randomly selected
        from the FTE-250. The average VAIC score for these firms in 1998 was 4.712.
        The average VAIC score of 70 publicly traded firms from Austria for 1997 was
        3.981. From a sample of 42 banks from Croatia the average VAIC score was approximately
        4.90.   for the same period as this study: SA values are comparable, Swedish
        values generally lower and UK slightly higher. Univariate analysis tests (independent
        Student t  test and Mann–Whitney U  test)10  10 Tests not reported in body
        of paper for brevity. Results can be obtained from the authors.   indicate
        that the national TVAE, TVAPC, and TVAIC means in Sweden were significantly
        lower than national means in SA and UK. Differences between national means
        for TVAE, TVAPC, and TVAIC in SA and UK, however, are not statistically significant.
        \  5 Results 5.1 Correlation analysis Pearson correlations reported in Table
        3   do not exceed .340. Also the variance inflation factor (VIF) values (calculated
        with every multiple regression model performed) not exceed 3.00. All VIF values
        are substantially below the critical value of 10.00 (Netter et al., 1989)
        . Based on Pearson correlations and VIF values, multicollinearity does not
        appear to be a serious concern11  11 To further test for multicollinearity,
        a series of multiple regression models were performed whereby a single independent
        variable or control factor was excluded from one model but subsequently included
        in the remainder. The purpose of these regression models was to determine
        if the exclusion of an independent variable or control factor altered the
        significance and directional sign on the coefficients of the remaining independent
        variables and control factors. Findings from these regressions show no significant
        changes; thus providing further support that multicollinearity was not a concern.
        \ .  5.2 Tests of 1a, 2a, 3a and 4a  Table 4   presents the results of three
        multiple regression models with TVAE as the dependent variable. Each regression
        model is statistically significant (P <.01) with the UK sample firms (see
        Table 4, Panel C ) explaining the highest proportions of variation in TVAE
        (40.3%) and SA sample firms (see Table 4, Panel A ) explaining the lowest
        (26.2%). The coefficients on Duality  are statistically significant and negative
        in all three regressions in Table 4  (P <.05). Amongst the other three independent
        variables, coefficients were only moderately statistically significant in
        two isolated cases. First, the coefficient for PerOutDir  is positive and
        statistically significant (P <.10) in the regression for SA sample firms only
        (see Table 4, Panel A ). Second, the coefficient for PerInsOwn  is positive
        and statistically significant (P <.10) in the regression for the Swedish sample
        firms only (see Table 4, Panel C ). Overall, and across the three countries,
        the empirical results presented in Table 4  support only Hypothesis 3a  whilst
        Hypothesis 4a  is rejected.  5.3 Tests of 1b, 2b, 3b, and 4b  Three regressions
        reported in Table 5   with TVAPC as the dependent variable are all statistically
        significant (P <.001). The regression including only SA sample firms explains
        the highest level of variation in the dependent variable (see Table 5, Panel
        A ). The regression including only Swedish firms explains the least (see Table
        5, Panel B ). Coefficients representing the four independent variables are
        only statistically significant in two cases. First, the coefficient for PerOutDir
        \ is positive and statistically significant (P <.01) in the regression including
        SA sample firms only (see Table 5, Panel A ). Second, the coefficient representing
        Board size  in the regression including UK sample firms only (see Table 5,
        Panel C ) is positive and is moderately statistically significant (P <.10).
        Based on findings reported in Table 5 , Hypotheses 2b and 3b  are rejected.
        \ 5.4 Tests of 1c, 2c, 3c, and 4c  Table 6   presents results of multiple
        regression analysis with TVAIC as the dependent variable. All regression models
        are statistically significant (P <.01). The regression comprising only SA
        sample firms (see Table 6, Panel A ) explained the highest variation (38.6%)
        in TVAIC. Conversely, the regression comprising only UK sample firms (see
        Table 6, Panel C ) explained the least variation (30.4%). Consistent with
        Hypothesis 3c , the findings show that the coefficients for Duality  are negative
        and statistically significant (P <.05, Panels A and B; P <.10, Panel C). Findings
        reported in Table 6  Panel C (regression containing only Swedish firms) show
        the coefficient for PerInsOwn  is positive and statistically significant (P
        <.01, Table 6, Panel B ). Coefficients representing PerInsOwn  in the remaining
        two regressions (Table 6, Panels A and C) , however, are not statistically
        significant. The results in Table 6  indicate no relationship between TVAIC
        and PerOutDir ; consequently, Hypothesis 1c  is rejected. Finally, coefficients
        for Board size  in the three regressions reported in Table 6  were negative
        and statistically insignificant; thus, Hypothesis 4c  is rejected.   6 Concluding
        remarks and future research initiatives The general purpose of this study
        is to provide an international comparative analysis of the association between
        four board features and corporate performance. These four board features are
        (1) proportion of outside directors, (2) percentage of inside directors' ownership,
        (3) duality, and (4) size of the board. In contrast to the bulk of prior research,
        the present study defines corporate performance within the concept of VA.
        Further, rather than considering VA within a holistic perspective, the present
        study examines the association between board features and efficiency of VA
        by the two major elements of a firm's resource base—namely PC and IC resources.
        Overall, empirical findings fail to show an unconditional link between board
        features and corporate performance across any of the three nations included
        in the present study. This result is consistent with prior empirical research
        utilizing U.S. data (i.e., Hermalin & Weisbach, 1991; Brickley et al., 1997;
        Klein, 1998 ). No specific board feature is associated with corporate performance.
        Rather, results show some significant associations between individual board
        features and individual measures of corporate performance in one nation or
        the other, but not consistently across all three. While the present study
        builds on an international setting, further research may address the impact
        of the introduction of codes or best practice guides of corporate governance
        on the efficiency of VA efficiency by a firm's PC and IC over time. Results
        of that type of research could then be compared with findings from studies
        of board feature–corporate performance links for nations that have not implemented
        codes or best practice guides of corporate governance. Other research could
        evaluate the links between board features and the VA by a firm's key resource
        bases with respect to corporate decisions that allow managerial opportunism
        such as the adoption of anti-takeover devices or the adoption of CEO evaluation
        processes. Finally, other research could utilize alternative theoretical frameworks—such
        as resource-dependence theory or institutional theory—to investigate possible
        links among other board features, corporate governance mechanisms, and corporate
        performance. Overall, this study makes three unique contributions. First,
        it provides the first large-scale evidence about the absence of systematic
        association between board features (composition, structure, and ownership)
        and corporate performance, which is defined as the efficiency of value added
        by a firm's resources. In addition, the present study further advances the
        analysis to determine if board features influence the efficiency of value
        added by a firm's two major resource base—(1) PC resources and (2) IC resources.
        Second, the study also contributes by conducting an international comparative
        analysis of board feature–corporate performance links in nations offering
        similar but diverse sociopolitical, economic and corporate governance environments.
        In particular, the present study provides evidence of associations between
        board features and corporate performance in nations—namely SA and Sweden—previously
        ignored in the literature. Finally, the present study provides one of the
        first attempts to capture the concept of IC. This is an important advance
        given the increasing significance of this concept and the growing disparity
        between a firm's book value and market value. Application of the VAIC methodology
        will assist in developing future research initiatives using these alternative
        measures to better meet the business environment of the information age.   Acknowledgements

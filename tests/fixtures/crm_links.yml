        animals with complex life cycles can cope with environmental uncertainty by
        altering the timing of life history switch points through plasticity. Pond
        hydroperiod has important consequences for the fitness of aquatic organisms
        and many taxa alter the timing of life history switch points in response to
        habitat desiccation. For example, larval amphibians can metamorphose early
        to escape drying ponds. Such plasticity may induce variation in size and morphology
        of juveniles which can result in carry-over effects on jumping performance.
        To investigate the carry-over effects of metamorphic plasticity to pond drying,
        we studied the T\u00fangara frog,<jats:italic>Physalaemus pustulosus<\/jats:italic>,
        a tropical anuran that breeds in highly ephemeral habitats. We conducted an
        outdoor field mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated water depth and
        desiccation and measured time and size at metamorphosis, tibiofibula length
        and jumping performance. We also conducted a complimentary laboratory experiment
        in which we manipulated resources, water depth and desiccation. In the field
        experiment, metamorphs from dry-down treatments emerged earlier, but at a
        similar size to metamorphs from constant depth treatments. In the laboratory
        experiment, metamorphs from the low depth and dry-down treatments emerged
        earlier and smaller. In both experiments, frogs from dry-down treatments had
        relatively shorter legs, which negatively impacted their absolute jumping
        performance. In contrast, reductions in resources delayed and reduced size
        at metamorphosis, but had no negative effect on jumping performance. To place
        these results in a broader context, we review past studies on carry-over effects
        of the larval environment on jumping performance. Reductions in mass and limb
        length generally resulted in lower jumping performance across juvenile anurans
        tested to date. Understanding the consequences of plasticity on size, morphology
        and performance can elucidate the linkages between life stages.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1268","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,22]],"date-time":"2015-09-22T08:23:41Z","timestamp":1442910221000},"page":"e1268","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Consequences

        with eight previously studied species from different crayfish families using
        morphological features and biometrical data. The ultrastructure of spermatozoa
        show a generally conserved pattern including an acrosome and nucleus in the
        anterior and posterior parts of the cell, respectively, radial arms that wrap
        around the nucleus, and the whole cell is enclosed by an extracellular capsule.
        The most outstanding morphological feature in spermatozoa of three studied
        cambarid crayfish is the crest-like protrusions in the anterior part of the
        acrosome that can be used as one of the features for distinguishing the members
        of this family. Results of biometrical data reveal that acrosome size in the
        representatives of Parastacidae are the smallest, while representatives of
        Astacidae show the biggest acrosome. The acrosome size in species belonging
        to Cambaridae occupy an intermediate position between the two other families
        of freshwater crayfish. In conclusion, a combination of morphological features
        and biometrical data of spermatozoa can help distinguishing different species

        animals with complex life cycles can cope with environmental uncertainty by
        altering the timing of life history switch points through plasticity. Pond
        hydroperiod has important consequences for the fitness of aquatic organisms
        and many taxa alter the timing of life history switch points in response to
        habitat desiccation. For example, larval amphibians can metamorphose early
        to escape drying ponds. Such plasticity may induce variation in size and morphology
        of juveniles which can result in carry-over effects on jumping performance.
        To investigate the carry-over effects of metamorphic plasticity to pond drying,
        we studied the T\u00fangara frog,<jats:italic>Physalaemus pustulosus<\/jats:italic>,
        a tropical anuran that breeds in highly ephemeral habitats. We conducted an
        outdoor field mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated water depth and
        desiccation and measured time and size at metamorphosis, tibiofibula length
        and jumping performance. We also conducted a complimentary laboratory experiment
        in which we manipulated resources, water depth and desiccation. In the field
        experiment, metamorphs from dry-down treatments emerged earlier, but at a
        similar size to metamorphs from constant depth treatments. In the laboratory
        experiment, metamorphs from the low depth and dry-down treatments emerged
        earlier and smaller. In both experiments, frogs from dry-down treatments had
        relatively shorter legs, which negatively impacted their absolute jumping
        performance. In contrast, reductions in resources delayed and reduced size
        at metamorphosis, but had no negative effect on jumping performance. To place
        these results in a broader context, we review past studies on carry-over effects
        of the larval environment on jumping performance. Reductions in mass and limb
        length generally resulted in lower jumping performance across juvenile anurans
        tested to date. Understanding the consequences of plasticity on size, morphology
        and performance can elucidate the linkages between life stages.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1268","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,22]],"date-time":"2015-09-22T08:23:41Z","timestamp":1442910221000},"page":"e1268","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Consequences

        animals with complex life cycles can cope with environmental uncertainty by
        altering the timing of life history switch points through plasticity. Pond
        hydroperiod has important consequences for the fitness of aquatic organisms
        and many taxa alter the timing of life history switch points in response to
        habitat desiccation. For example, larval amphibians can metamorphose early
        to escape drying ponds. Such plasticity may induce variation in size and morphology
        of juveniles which can result in carry-over effects on jumping performance.
        To investigate the carry-over effects of metamorphic plasticity to pond drying,
        we studied the T\u00fangara frog,<jats:italic>Physalaemus pustulosus<\/jats:italic>,
        a tropical anuran that breeds in highly ephemeral habitats. We conducted an
        outdoor field mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated water depth and
        desiccation and measured time and size at metamorphosis, tibiofibula length
        and jumping performance. We also conducted a complimentary laboratory experiment
        in which we manipulated resources, water depth and desiccation. In the field
        experiment, metamorphs from dry-down treatments emerged earlier, but at a
        similar size to metamorphs from constant depth treatments. In the laboratory
        experiment, metamorphs from the low depth and dry-down treatments emerged
        earlier and smaller. In both experiments, frogs from dry-down treatments had
        relatively shorter legs, which negatively impacted their absolute jumping
        performance. In contrast, reductions in resources delayed and reduced size
        at metamorphosis, but had no negative effect on jumping performance. To place
        these results in a broader context, we review past studies on carry-over effects
        of the larval environment on jumping performance. Reductions in mass and limb
        length generally resulted in lower jumping performance across juvenile anurans
        tested to date. Understanding the consequences of plasticity on size, morphology

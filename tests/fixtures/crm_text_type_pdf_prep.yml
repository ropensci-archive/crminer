        intensification is one of the major drivers of biotic homogenization and has
        multiple levels ranging from within-field management intensity to landscape-scale
        simplification. The enhancement of invertebrate assemblages by establishing
        new, semi-natural habitats, such as set-aside fields can improve biological
        pest control in adjacent crops, and mitigate the adverse effect of biotic
        homogenization. In this study we aimed to examine the effects of ecological
        intensification in winter wheat fields in Hungary. We tested how pests and
        their natural enemies were affected at different spatial scales by landscape
        composition (proportion of semi-natural habitats in the surrounding matrix),
        configuration (presence of adjacent set-aside fields), and local field management
        practices, such as fertilizer (NPK) applications without applying insecticides.
        We demonstrated that at the local scale, decreased fertilizer usage had no
        direct effect either on pests or their natural enemies. Higher landscape complexity
        and adjacent semi-natural habitats seem to be the major drivers of decreasing
        aphid abundance, suggesting that these enhanced the predatory insect assemblages.
        Additionally, the high yield in plots with no adjacent set-aside fields suggests
        that intensive management can compensate for the lower yields on the extensive
        plots. Our results demonstrated that although complexity at the landscape
        scale was crucial for maintaining invertebrate assemblages, divergence in
        their response to pests and pathogens could also be explained by different
        dispersal abilities. Although the landscape attributes acted as dispersal
        filters in the organization of pest and pathogen assemblages in croplands,
        the presence of set-aside fields negatively influenced aphid abundance due
        to their between-field isolation effect.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8746","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,27]],"date-time":"2020-03-27T08:47:11Z","timestamp":1585298831000},"page":"e8746","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Mixed

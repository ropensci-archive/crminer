        animals with complex life cycles can cope with environmental uncertainty by
        altering the timing of life history switch points through plasticity. Pond
        hydroperiod has important consequences for the fitness of aquatic organisms
        and many taxa alter the timing of life history switch points in response to
        habitat desiccation. For example, larval amphibians can metamorphose early
        to escape drying ponds. Such plasticity may induce variation in size and morphology
        of juveniles which can result in carry-over effects on jumping performance.
        To investigate the carry-over effects of metamorphic plasticity to pond drying,
        we studied the T\u00fangara frog,<jats:italic>Physalaemus pustulosus<\/jats:italic>,
        a tropical anuran that breeds in highly ephemeral habitats. We conducted an
        outdoor field mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated water depth and
        desiccation and measured time and size at metamorphosis, tibiofibula length
        and jumping performance. We also conducted a complimentary laboratory experiment
        in which we manipulated resources, water depth and desiccation. In the field
        experiment, metamorphs from dry-down treatments emerged earlier, but at a
        similar size to metamorphs from constant depth treatments. In the laboratory
        experiment, metamorphs from the low depth and dry-down treatments emerged
        earlier and smaller. In both experiments, frogs from dry-down treatments had
        relatively shorter legs, which negatively impacted their absolute jumping
        performance. In contrast, reductions in resources delayed and reduced size
        at metamorphosis, but had no negative effect on jumping performance. To place
        these results in a broader context, we review past studies on carry-over effects
        of the larval environment on jumping performance. Reductions in mass and limb
        length generally resulted in lower jumping performance across juvenile anurans
        tested to date. Understanding the consequences of plasticity on size, morphology
        and performance can elucidate the linkages between life stages.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1268","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,22]],"date-time":"2015-09-22T08:23:41Z","timestamp":1442910221000},"page":"e1268","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Consequences
